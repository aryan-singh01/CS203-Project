# Project Report: Implementation of a 32-bit Floating Point Multiplier in Verilog

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a **32-bit Floating Point Multiplier** in Verilog, adhering to the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision floating-point representation. The multiplier supports basic arithmetic, normalization, rounding, and exception handling mechanisms. It is a key component in high-performance computing, digital signal processing, and various numerical computation applications.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to design a hardware-based 32-bit Floating Point Multiplier. The implementation must:
- Extract and process the **sign**, **exponent**, and **mantissa** from the operands.
- Perform **mantissa multiplication** using efficient gate-level operations.
- Handle **normalization**, **rounding**, and special cases (e.g., NaN, infinity, and zero).
- Ensure compliance with the IEEE 754 standard.

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Sign Calculation**: Determine the resultâ€™s sign using XOR gates.
2. **Exponent Addition**: Add the exponents with bias adjustment, ensuring proper handling of overflow and underflow.
3. **Mantissa Multiplication**: Multiply the mantissas using a Wallace Tree Multiplier structure.
4. **Normalization**: Normalize the result by adjusting the mantissa and exponent.
5. **Rounding**: Round the normalized result to fit within 23 bits for the mantissa.
6. **Special Cases**: Handle conditions like NaN, infinity, zero, overflow, and underflow.

## Design and Implementation

### **Sign Calculation**
The sign of the result is determined by XORing the signs of the two input numbers:
- Input: `sign_a`, `sign_b`
- Output: `sign_result`
- Implementation: XOR gate

#### Verilog Code:
```verilog
module SignCalculation (
    input sign_a,
    input sign_b,
    output sign_result
);
    xor(sign_result, sign_a, sign_b);
endmodule
```

### **Exponent Calculation**
Exponents are added, and the bias of 127 (IEEE 754 standard) is subtracted. A Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA) is used for gate-level addition.

#### Verilog Code:
```verilog
module RippleCarryAdder (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input cin,
    output [7:0] sum,
    output cout
);
    wire [8:0] carry;
    assign carry[0] = cin;

    genvar i;
    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin : ADDER_STAGE
            assign sum[i] = a[i] ^ b[i] ^ carry[i];
            assign carry[i + 1] = (a[i] & b[i]) | (b[i] & carry[i]) | (a[i] & carry[i]);
        end
    endgenerate

    assign cout = carry[8];
endmodule
```

### **Mantissa Multiplication**
Mantissa multiplication is performed using a **Wallace Tree Multiplier**, which generates partial products and reduces them efficiently using adders.

#### Partial Product Generation:
```verilog
module PartialProductGenerator (
    input [23:0] a,
    input [23:0] b,
    output [23:0] pp [23:0] // 24 partial products
);
    genvar i, j;
    generate
        for (i = 0; i < 24; i = i + 1) begin : ROW_GEN
            for (j = 0; j < 24; j = j + 1) begin : COL_GEN
                and(pp[i][j], a[i], b[j]); // AND gate for each partial product bit
            end
        end
    endgenerate
endmodule
```

### **Normalization and Rounding**
The normalization logic ensures the mantissa fits within 23 bits while adjusting the exponent appropriately. Rounding logic rounds the result to maintain precision.

#### Normalization Code:
```verilog
module Normalize (
    input [47:0] mantissa,
    input [7:0] exponent,
    output reg [23:0] normalized_mantissa,
    output reg [8:0] normalized_exponent
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (mantissa[47]) begin
            normalized_mantissa = mantissa[46:23];
            normalized_exponent = exponent + 1;
        end else begin
            normalized_mantissa = mantissa[45:22];
            normalized_exponent = exponent - 1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### **Special Cases Handling**
- **NaN**: If either operand is NaN, the result is NaN.
- **Infinity**: If one operand is infinity, the result depends on the other operand.
- **Zero**: Multiplication by zero results in zero.
- **Overflow**: Exponents exceeding the representable range result in infinity.
- **Underflow**: Exponents below the minimum range result in zero.

---

## Testbench
A comprehensive testbench was developed to validate the multiplier. Test cases include:
- Multiplication of positive and negative numbers.
- Edge cases: NaN, infinity, zero, subnormal numbers.
- Overflow and underflow scenarios.

### Sample Test Case:
```verilog
initial begin
    $monitor("Time: %0t | A: %h | B: %h | Result: %h", $time, a, b, result);

    // Test Case 1: Multiply 1.5 and 2.5
    a = 32'h3FC00000; // 1.5
    b = 32'h40200000; // 2.5
    #10;

    // Test Case 2: Multiply by zero
    a = 32'h00000000; // 0.0
    b = 32'h40400000; // 3.0
    #10;

    // Additional cases: infinity, NaN, and edge values...
end
```
